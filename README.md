# Computational Methods for Fintech
## A work in progress - Last updated 12/22/2023


This repository contains analysis for the midterm paper for the Computational Methods for FinTech course. In order to view the content, the quarto file has been rendered into an HTML document as well as a word document ( DOCX ). Both are labeled midterm with the appropriate suffix. 

The midterm paper examines concepts around financial technology and innovation from a catallactic or market process perspective. It includes both theoretical discussion as well as data analysis.

## Contents

The repository includes the following key components:

- Foundations
  - Discussion of the knowledge problem and its implications for financial technology and artificial intelligence

- Arbitrage 
  - Examination of arbitrage concepts like the Dutch Book argument and their relationship to probability

- Case Study 
  - Analysis of the Metallgesellschaft hedging crisis through statistical analysis and simulation
  
- Tutorial Appendices
  - Technical background on concepts like cointegration, unit roots, error correction, and predictive distributions

The analysis is carried out through a combination of Quarto reports for theoretical discussion and Python/Jupyter notebooks for data analysis.

Overall this provides a catallactic foundation for thinking about issues in financial innovation from both a theoretical and practical perspective.
